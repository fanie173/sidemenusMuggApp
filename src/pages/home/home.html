    We know that coffee is the only thing keeping every day from feeling like a Monday.<br>
     Even Mondays. That’s why waiting for it in long queues is not helping world peace.<br>
      So don’t. sMugg is a brand new app for your Android or iOS device that helps you skip the queues and get straight to the java.<br>
       And by “skipping the queues” we mean you don’t even have to leave your car, <br>
       the coffee comes to you. Now that’s coffee to go! <br>
       So how does sMugg work? The app uses GPS technology to help you find and place your coffee order at a network of partner coffee shops.<br>
        You can then arrange a pick-up time and a runner will meet you curb-side with your order ready to go.<br>
         No need to get out of your car. Cappuccino? Sugar? No milk? sMugg comes with a range of features to help you get your order just right.<br>
          You can even cancel or delay your pick-up time when you’re stuck in traffic, save your favourite coffee shops and orders for future use, <br>
          and it allows your location to be tracked by coffee shops so they know when to get your order ready.
          <br> Sound like your kind of cup of coffee? Download sMugg for your device via the links below and enjoy coffee without the queues. Oh, and world peace.
